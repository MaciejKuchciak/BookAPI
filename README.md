# BookAPI

An API for managing books.

---

## About application

This API is used for book management. Data to feed our program is stored directly in the code, and for this purpose class `MemoryBookService` has been created with a private List, to which we can add example books in the constructor. For your convinience a file `book.http` has been added up to the project to insert already prepared commands in the console.

Within this project I used:
> - Spring
> - Spring MVC
> - Dependency Injection
> - Import and use of external libraries.
